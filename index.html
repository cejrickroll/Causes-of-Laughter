<h1>Theories on the causes of humor</h1>

<h2>1. Superiority Theory</h2>

<p>"Perhaps the oldest theory of humor, which dates back to Plato and other</p>

<p>ancient Greek philosophers, posits that people find humor in, and laugh</p>

<p>at, earlier versions of themselves and the misfortunes of others because</p>

<p>of feeling superior." <span>What’s So Funny? The Science of Why We Laugh</span></p>

<p>Plato was the first known supporter of this theory, followed by Aristotle</p>

<p>and later Thomas Hobbes. This theory came from negative emotions often</p>

<p>originating from being laughed at or made fun of.</p>

<h2>2. Release Theory</h2>

<p>"The 18th century gave rise to the theory of release. The best-known version,</p>

<p>formulated later by Sigmund Freud, held that laughter allows people to let off</p>

<p>steam or release pent-up 'nervous energy.' According to Freud, this process</p>

<p>explains why tabooed scatological and sexual themes and jokes that broach</p>

<p>thorny social and ethnic topics can amuse us." <span>What’s So Funny? The Science</span></p>

<p><span>of Why We Laugh</span> It is the manifestation of natural pre-conscious thoughts</p>

<p>suppressed by stigma or tension in 'conventional' conversation, with the energy</p>

<p>used to withhold 'inappropriate' thoughts from the conscious mind becoming</p>

<p>released as laughter. Unlike other theories, this one focuses on laughter instead</p>

<p>of the abstract concept of humour.</p>

<h2>3. Incongruity theory</h2>

<p>"People laugh at the juxtaposition of incompatible concepts and at defiance of</p>

<p>their expectations - that is, at the incongruity between expectations and reality."</p>

<p><span>What’s So Funny? The Science of Why We Laugh</span></p>

<p>The theory is that the human brain has a vivid imagination that attempts to</p>

<p>predict future events, and when the brain is forced to comprehend two realities</p>

<p>at once, the confusion that results is experienced as humour.</p>

<h2>4. Violation Theory</h2>

<p>“Three necessary and (jointly) sufficient conditions for humour perception. When</p>

<p>one of these conditions is lacking, there is no humour perception and if all three</p>

<p>are present, humour perception is also there." <span>Humour Research: State of the Art</span></p>

<p><img alt="Table 1 – The three -level scale" src="Violation Theory Table.png" /></p>

<h5>Table 1 – The three -level scale</h5>

<p>· V - The violation of a certain commitment of the perceiver about how things ought to be.</p>

<p>· N - The perceiver has the dominating feeling that the certain situation is normal.</p>

<p>· Simultaneity - These two understandings V and N have to be present in the mind of</p>

<p>the perceiver at the same time.</p>

<p>This theory aims to combine the incongruity and superiority theories by turning them</p>

<p>into individual conditions to be fulfilled for humour to manifest. The violation component</p>

<p>matches with the incongruity theory and the understanding component in turn corresponds</p>

<p>with feelings of superiority towards the past self.</p>

<h2>5. Social Theory</h2>

<p>"Friends are more likely to produce spontaneous laughs, while strangers who lack an</p>

<p>established emotional connection are more likely to produce volitional laughter… The</p>

<p>acoustic characteristics of authentic laughter are therefore useful cues to the bonds</p>

<p>between and status of members of a group." <span>The evolutionary origins of laughter are</span></p>

<p><span>rooted more in survival than enjoyment</span></p>

<p>In this theory, laughter is utilised as a sign of trustworthiness, alliance, and social status.</p>

<h2>À La <strong>How Laughter Works</strong>/Peter Derks</h2>

<p>"Derks traced the pattern of brainwave activity in subjects responding to humorous</p>

<p>material. Subjects were hooked up to an electroencephalograph (EEG) and their brain</p>

<p>activity was measured when they laughed. In each case, the brain produced a regular</p>

<p>electrical pattern. Within four-tenths of a second of exposure to something potentially</p>

<p>funny, an electrical wave moved through the cerebral cortex, the largest part of the brain.</p>

<p>If the wave took a negative charge, laughter resulted. If it maintained a positive charge,</p>

<p>no response was given, researchers said.</p>

<p>During the experiment, researchers observed the following specific activities:</p>

<p>• The left side of the cortex (the layer of cells that covers the entire surface of the forebrain)</p>

<p>analysed the words and structure of the joke.</p>

<p>• The brain's large frontal lobe, which is involved in social emotional responses, became very</p>

<p>active.</p>

<p>• The right hemisphere of the cortex carried out the intellectual analysis required to "get" the</p>

<p>joke.</p>

<p>• Brainwave activity then spread to the sensory processing area of the occipital lobe (the area</p>

<p>on the back of the head that contains the cells that process visual signals).</p>

<p>• Stimulation of the motor sections evoked physical responses to the joke." <span>How Laughter Works</span></p>

<p>These are the parts of the brain that were most noticeably involved in the carrying out</p>

<p>of laughter, including the cerebral cortex, the frontal lobe, the occipital lobe partially,</p>

<p>and the motor sections.</p>

<h2>À La <strong>Neural Correlates of Laughter and Humour</strong></h2>

<p>“To summarize the results of many studies, the expression of laughterseems to depend</p>

<p>on two partially independent neuronal pathways. The first of these, an `involuntary' or</p>

<p>`emotionally driven' system, involves the amygdala, thalamic/hypo- and subthalamic</p>

<p>areas and the dorsal/tegmental brainstem. The second, `voluntary' system originates in</p>

<p>the premotor/frontal opercular areas and leads through the motor cortex and pyramidal</p>

<p>tract to the ventral brainstem. These systems and the laughter response appear to be</p>

<p>coordinated by a laughter-coordinating centre in the dorsal upper pons.” <span>Neural</span></p>

<p><span>Correlates of Laughter and Humour</span> The brain activity that causes laughter</p>

<p>results from the collaboration of two different systems of neurons. These are the unconscious</p>

<p>system, consisting of the amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus, dorsal brainstem,</p>

<p>and tegmental brainstem, and the conscious, in which a thought process travels through the</p>

<p>premotor and frontal opercular areas, the motor cortex, and the pyramidal tract into the ventral</p>

<p>brainstem. The end result is coordinated and processed in the dorsal upper pons.</p>
